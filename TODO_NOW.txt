# TODO NOW - Performance & Efficiency Fixes
## Priority: IMMEDIATE - Zero Overhead Vision

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUES (Fix Today)

#### 1. File Watcher Overhead - MASSIVE INEFFICIENCY
**Location**: `mothership-daemon/src/file_watcher.rs:130`
**Problem**: Reading ENTIRE file content on EVERY file save + sending via unbounded channels
**Impact**: 10MB file = 10MB through channels per save (auto-save every 1s during editing)
**Fix**:
- [ ] Send only file path + timestamp, not content
- [ ] Implement lazy content loading on-demand
- [ ] Add file size limits (skip files > 1MB automatically)
- [ ] Debounce file events (minimum 100ms between same-file events)

#### 2. Broadcast Content Spam - NETWORK KILLER
**Location**: `mothership-server/src/sync.rs:91`
**Problem**: Broadcasting FULL file content to ALL users on every file save
**Impact**: 5 users Ã— 100KB file = 500KB network per save (auto-save every 1s during editing)
**Fix**:
- [ ] Send diffs only, not full content
- [ ] Implement incremental sync protocol
- [ ] Add content compression before broadcast
- [ ] Smart batching of multiple rapid changes

#### 3. Auto-Save/Checkpoint Spam - I/O THRASHING
**Location**: `mothership-gui/main.js:245` + `mothership-common/src/lib.rs:54`
**Problem**: Auto-save every 1s + checkpoint every 10s = constant disk I/O
**Impact**: Continuous disk thrashing, poor battery life, system lag
**Fix**:
- [ ] Increase auto-save to 3-5 seconds minimum
- [ ] Increase auto-checkpoint to 60 seconds minimum  
- [ ] Implement smart debouncing (only save if content actually changed)
- [ ] Add "typing mode" detection to pause auto-operations

#### 4. Naive History Storage - STORAGE EXPLOSION
**Location**: `mothership-server/src/storage.rs:87`
**Problem**: Storing full files for every checkpoint, no diffs
**Impact**: 1000-file project = GBs of storage per day
**Fix**:
- [ ] Implement proper diff generation (git-style)
- [ ] Add compression for stored content
- [ ] Implement content deduplication beyond simple hashing
- [ ] Background garbage collection of old checkpoints

#### 5. Memory Leaks - UNBOUNDED GROWTH
**Location**: Multiple unbounded channels throughout codebase
**Problem**: Full file content accumulating in channels
**Impact**: Memory usage grows unbounded, eventual OOM
**Fix**:
- [ ] Replace unbounded channels with bounded channels (capacity: 100)
- [ ] Implement backpressure handling
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Background cleanup of old channel messages

### âš¡ IMMEDIATE OPTIMIZATIONS (This Week)

#### File Watching Intelligence
- [ ] Implement .gitignore-style filtering (respect existing .gitignore)
- [ ] Skip binary files entirely (add MIME type detection)
- [ ] Batch multiple rapid file changes (debounce window: 200ms)
- [ ] Add file extension allowlist (only track code files)

#### Network Protocol Efficiency  
- [ ] Implement WebSocket message compression
- [ ] Add message batching (send max every 100ms)
- [ ] Delta compression for file content
- [ ] Connection pooling for multiple projects

#### Storage Optimizations
- [ ] Add LZ4 compression for all stored content
- [ ] Implement rolling checkpoints (keep last 50, archive older)
- [ ] Add storage quota limits per project
- [ ] Background storage optimization job

#### Real-Time Sync Performance
- [ ] Implement operational transforms for conflict-free editing
- [ ] Add presence awareness (show active editors)
- [ ] Smart conflict detection (only check when multiple editors)
- [ ] Cursor position sync with minimal bandwidth

### ðŸŽ¯ ZERO OVERHEAD VISION

#### Target Performance Metrics
- [ ] **File save latency**: < 50ms from save to network broadcast
- [ ] **Memory usage**: < 50MB base + 1MB per tracked project
- [ ] **Network traffic**: < 1KB per file save (diff-based)
- [ ] **Storage growth**: < 10MB per day for typical project
- [ ] **CPU usage**: < 5% during active editing

#### Smart Resource Management
- [ ] Adaptive performance based on system resources
- [ ] Pause expensive operations during battery mode
- [ ] Scale broadcast frequency based on number of connected users
- [ ] Intelligent caching with LRU eviction

#### Background Intelligence
- [ ] Detect idle periods and optimize accordingly
- [ ] Smart checkpoint timing (avoid during active editing)
- [ ] Prefetch likely-to-be-accessed content
- [ ] Background defragmentation of storage

### ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DEBT (Next Sprint)

#### Code Quality
- [ ] Remove all TODO comments and implement proper solutions
- [ ] Add proper error handling everywhere (no more `.unwrap()`)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging with performance metrics
- [ ] Add unit tests for all performance-critical paths

#### Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Separate concerns: file watching, networking, storage
- [ ] Implement proper async streaming for large files
- [ ] Add circuit breakers for failing operations
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation modes

#### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Real-time performance dashboard
- [ ] Memory usage alerts
- [ ] Network traffic monitoring
- [ ] Storage growth tracking
- [ ] User experience metrics (latency, errors)

### ðŸ“Š SUCCESS CRITERIA

#### Before Optimization (Current State)
- [ ] Measure current memory usage during typical editing session
- [ ] Benchmark file save latency end-to-end
- [ ] Measure storage growth over 1-hour editing session
- [ ] Test network usage with multiple connected users

#### After Optimization (Target State)
- [ ] Memory usage stays flat during long editing sessions
- [ ] File saves feel instantaneous (< 100ms perceived latency)
- [ ] Storage grows linearly, not exponentially
- [ ] Network traffic scales efficiently with users
- [ ] System remains responsive under heavy load

## ðŸ’¡ ZERO OVERHEAD PHILOSOPHY

"Every operation should feel instantaneous. Every byte should serve a purpose. Every cycle should move us forward."

The goal: Mothership should feel lighter than Git, faster than VS Code Live Share, and more responsive than Google Docs - even while doing more than all of them combined.

**No compromises. No "good enough." Zero overhead. Maximum flow.**
