  - `i,a,o` to enter insert mode
  - `v` for visual mode
  - `:w` to save (or auto-save works)
  - `dd` to delete lines
  - `yy` to copy lines
  - And many more!

#### Auto-Save
- Files automatically save 1 second after you stop typing
- No need to manually save files
- Console logs show successful auto-saves

### üéØ Checkpoints (Version Control)
1. Make changes to a file
2. Click the **"Checkpoint"** button
3. Add an optional message describing your changes
4. The checkpoint is created and synced with the Mothership server

#### Syntax Highlighting
The editor supports syntax highlighting for:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Rust
- Go
- Java
- C/C++
- HTML/CSS
- JSON/YAML
- Markdown
- And many more languages

#### Editor Features
- **Minimap** for file overview
- **Line numbers** and current line highlighting
- **Code folding** for functions and blocks
- **Word wrapping** for long lines
- **Smooth scrolling** and cursor animations
- **Multiple cursors** (Ctrl+Click)

- Commands: `:w,:q,:wq` and more

## Next Steps

This proof-of-concept demonstrates the potential for a revolutionary version control experience. Future enhancements could include:

- **Real-time collaboration** with live cursors
- **Integrated terminal** for command execution  
- **Advanced diff viewing** for change visualization
- **Plugin system** for custom configurations
- **Multi-tab editing** for multiple files
- **Project templates** and scaffolding tools

The foundation is solid for building a complete development environment that could compete with traditional tools while providing a superior user experience.
