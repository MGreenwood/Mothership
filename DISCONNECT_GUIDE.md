# Mothership Disconnect & Daemon Management Guide

## **Complete Daemon Lifecycle Management**

Mothership now provides **complete graceful disconnection** from projects and **full daemon lifecycle management**. No more orphaned daemons or manual process killing!

## **The Problem We Solved**

**Before (Missing):**
- No way to disconnect from projects
- Daemon ran forever once started
- No graceful shutdown
- Manual process killing required

**After (Complete):**
- Graceful project disconnection
- Full daemon lifecycle management
- Automatic "last one out" handling
- Clean shutdown and restart

## **New Commands**

### **1. Project Disconnection**
```bash
# Disconnect from specific project
mothership disconnect "my-project"

# Disconnect from current project (auto-detected)
cd my-project-directory
mothership disconnect
```

### **2. Daemon Status**
```bash
# Check if daemon is running + show tracked projects
mothership daemon status
```

### **3. Daemon Control**
```bash
# Stop daemon gracefully
mothership daemon stop

# Restart daemon (stops + starts fresh)
mothership daemon restart
```

## **Complete Lifecycle Example**

```bash
# 1. Start tracking projects
mothership beam "project-alpha"    # Starts daemon + tracks project-alpha
mothership beam "project-beta"     # Reuses daemon + tracks project-beta

# 2. Check what's being tracked
mothership daemon status
# Shows: daemon running, 2 projects tracked

# 3. Disconnect from one project
mothership disconnect "project-alpha"
mothership daemon status
# Shows: daemon running, 1 project tracked (project-beta)

# 4. Disconnect from last project
mothership disconnect "project-beta"
mothership daemon status
# Shows: daemon running, 0 projects tracked (daemon stays alive)

# 5. Stop daemon completely
mothership daemon stop
mothership daemon status
# Shows: daemon not running

# 6. Restart fresh
mothership daemon restart
# Starts new daemon, no projects tracked
```

## **Daemon Behavior**

### **Individual Disconnect:**
- Removes project from tracking
- Stops file watcher for that project
- **Keeps daemon running** for other projects

### **Last One Out:**
- Daemon stays alive but idle
- Ready to accept new projects instantly
- No overhead when no projects tracked

### **Graceful Shutdown:**
- Stops all file watchers
- Cleans up resources
- Sends confirmation before exit

## **Smart Features**

### **Auto-Detection:**
```bash
cd my-project-directory
mothership disconnect  # Automatically detects project from .mothership/project.json
```

### **Error Handling:**
```bash
mothership disconnect "nonexistent-project"
# Error: Project 'nonexistent-project' not found on server.

mothership daemon stop
# When daemon not running: "Mothership daemon is not running - nothing to stop"
```

### **Helpful Messages:**
```bash
mothership disconnect "my-project"
# Successfully disconnected from project 'my-project'
#  The project is no longer being tracked by the background daemon
#  Files will not sync automatically until you beam back in
```

## **Zero-Friction Philosophy**

The disconnect functionality maintains Mothership's **Zero Fear, Zero Ceremony, Zero Friction** philosophy:

- **Zero Fear**: Can't break anything - graceful operations only
- **Zero Ceremony**: Simple commands, helpful feedback
- **Zero Friction**: Smart auto-detection, no manual process management

## **Testing**

Run our comprehensive test:
```bash
.\test-disconnect-functionality.bat
```

This tests the complete lifecycle from daemon startup through disconnection to shutdown.

**Result: Complete daemon lifecycle management with zero manual intervention required!**
