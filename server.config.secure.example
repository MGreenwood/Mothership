# Security Best Practices:
# 1. Create team-whitelist.config with authorized users
# 2. Set OAuth environment variables (GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, etc.)
# 3. Set strong JWT_SECRET environment variable  
# 4. Configure a reverse proxy (nginx/caddy) with:
#    - HTTPS termination
#    - Rate limiting
#    - IP filtering if needed
#    - Security headers
# 5. Use firewall rules to restrict access if needed
